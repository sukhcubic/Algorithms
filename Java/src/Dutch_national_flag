//Dutch national flag. Given an array of nn buckets, each containing a red, white, or blue pebble, sort them by color. The allowed operations are:

//swap(i, j)swap(i,j): swap the pebble in bucket ii with the pebble in bucket jj.
//color(i)color(i): determine the color of the pebble in bucket ii.
//The performance requirements are as follows:

//At most nn calls to color()color().
//At most nn calls to swap()swap().
//Constant extra space.
